## Introduction To This Project
Hi there welcome to Moxira. This game is built off of Luanti (formerly Minetest), this game is gonna be awesome. I may go around and select a few people to be pre-release testers. See the problems. You can even contribute to!! if you like. You can donate at [Xi's Donation Station](https://buymeacoffee.com/xi_self13). Feel free. This game is gonna be awesome!!! >u<. 

## Legal Status for Me and Terraria.
As the developers stated, we cannot copy any assets, name, item names, basically anything from Terraria. This idea has to be original. And is. How? We did not copy the name. Assets concepts nor used music Scott Lylod Shelly made (and it's pretty impressive and amazing! >O<)

My status. We are good!! No reports from the developers.

## Feature (This is my favorite part!) UoU
Here is some features listed below! Right now they is concepts and may not be final when the game actually releases.
### NPCs
* Co-Guide - Knows some about the game, but not all. Unlike the Guide from Terraria
* Builders - Provides building tools. And can build! No clouded AI will be used yet.
* Jarid Pets - Cursed bunny person. Sells pets and other goodies.
* Childrens - Kids can run around and play. If they die cause of you when you is around. Say bye bye to your reputation. -90%
* Mayor - can manages town sections. 
* Resource Gathers - Can gather resources per tasks given.

That's it for now.

### Game Mechanics 
* Certain NPCs like certain biomes, there can also be more then one types of certain NPCs. Like Resource Gatherers and such.
* You have hunger, health, advance health, stanima, body temp., and other real life like things. 

That's all for now.

## Inspiration
* Terraria for all of cool tools and good game mechanics with NPCs.
* Minecraft for the almost similar 3D version of Terraria.
* Lunati (Formerly Minetest) for Open Sourced Minecraft (OSMC) and our base to Moxira 
* Vintage Story for the almost real experience and blocky. The character designs is amazing! Player and some NPCs will adopt this style
* Bloxd.io for the abilty to have a Minecraft alternative but online!!


Thanks for inspiring for making this. And providing the base game engine I need! 

## Lore? MMMM...  Not yet.
